# Gaze-tracking
Gaze tracking model with a timer, that counts summary of time that person's eyes are recognised in video.
The use of this model is relevant for tracking the level of employee concentration. for example, if an employee is distracted from work and does not look at the monitor for a long time, the timer will be suspended and will resume only when the person returns to his duties. Also, the use of the model is relevant for tracking the level of fatigue of a person at a computer. you can modify the program so that it signals that a person is often distracted, and therefore tired. This model was developed by me as part of the diploma project of the digital department in the 3rd year of the bachelor's degree.
